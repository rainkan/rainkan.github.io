I am a 4th year Ph.D. student at the Michael G. Foster School of Business, University of Washington, specializing in Information Systems. My research interests revolve around AI, Economics, and Policy. I employ a range of methodologies such as Econometrics, Experimental Design, and Machine Learning to explore these areas. Prior to my time at Foster, I earned a Master of Science in Analytics degree from the Georgia Institute of Technology and a Bachelor's degree from Peking University.
