"I am a 4th year Ph.D. student at the [Michael G. Foster School of Business](https://foster.uw.edu/faculty-research/academic-departments/information-systems-and-operations-management/), University of Washington, specializing in Information Systems. My research interests revolve around Recommender Systems, the Economic Impact of Unstructured Data, Crowdfunding, and Social Media Networks. I employ a range of methodologies such as Econometrics, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Experimental Design, and Machine Learning to explore these areas. Prior to my time at Foster, I earned a Master of Science in Analytics degree from the Georgia Institute of Technology and a Bachelor's degree in Linguistics from Peking University."
