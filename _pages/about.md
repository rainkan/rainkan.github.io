I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Operations & Decision Technologies](https://kelley.iu.edu/faculty-research/departments/operations-decision-technologies/index.html) at the [Kelley School of Business](https://kelley.iu.edu/), Indiana University. My research focuses on the intersection of AI, economics, and policy, with an emphasis on digital marketing and e-commerce and I employs methodologies such as machine learning, econometrics, and experimental design to explore these areas.

Before joining IU, I earned a Ph.D. in Information Systems from the Michael G. Foster School of Business, University of Washington, as well as an M.S. in Analytics from the Georgia Institute of Technology and a B.A. in German Linguistics from Peking University.
